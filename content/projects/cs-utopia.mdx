## About

Our esteemed client was none other than our university itself. Recognizing the need for a platform to assist post-school students in selecting their desired specialties, we embarked on a brainstorming journey. The outcome? CS Utopiaâ€”a platform designed to ignite interest in computer science courses among students.

The platform offers interactive quizzes and essential learning materials covering a myriad of computer science topics. From algorithms to data structures, users can engage with dynamic content to deepen their understanding and enhance their learning journey.
