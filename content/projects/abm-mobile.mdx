## Challenge

Ace Battle Association was a very specific client, being a new organization without any previous IT projects implemented. Throughout a year of working with this company, we initiated multiple projects and continuously updated existing ones.

## Functionality

### Memberships

The task was to build a user-friendly membership-based user roles system. The roles include:

> - Visitor (Base role)
> - Runner
> - Coach
> - Manager

Each role has different access to various pages, and there is connectivity between roles, ensuring a seamless experience for users based on their roles and permissions.
